## How It Works:

**Game Initiation:** The journey begins when the first user kicks off a game. This user becomes the host and, more importantly, the one to share the exclusive room code that grants access to the scavenger hunt.

**Join the Hunt:** Friends, family, and fellow adventurers can easily join in on the action using the shared room code. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and ready to dive into the hunt.

**The Ultimate Scavenger List:** Once gathered in the virtual room, all participants receive the same list of items to find. This list is your treasure map to victory, and it's time to put on your detective hat!

**See and Be Seen:** The magic of "Hunt" is that it brings everyone together visually. Participants can see each other's live camera feeds, making it easier to strategize, compete, and observe what items others have already uncovered. It's like being right there with your fellow treasure hunters, sharing the thrill of discovery.

**Victory Awaits:** The hunt continues until one astute player successfully finds all the items on the list. When this happens, the game reaches its thrilling climax, and the bragging rights are up for grabs!

**Claim the Crown:** The player with the highest score emerges as the ultimate victor. So, channel your inner detective, and aim to top the leaderboard by finding the most items and proving your scavenger hunt prowess.
